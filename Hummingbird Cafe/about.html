            <p>From a young age, it has been the dream of Jessica Houghton, her two daughters, Cali and Kelsie Minkie, and their grandmother Renee Houghton, to own and run their own cafe based on one of the most resilient creatures in nature, the Hummingbird. The Hummingbird, although tiny and small, is a symbol of resiliency, strength, and persistence. It is their hope that the Hummingbird Cafe will serve as an oasis to those in need of a catalyst for change.</p>
